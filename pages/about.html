					I am a photographer and programmer based in Chicago. Working as a freelancer I have been able to
					focus on my photography as well as my programming. With 6 years of coding experience and 4 years of
					photography experience.
					<br> <br> <br>

					As a photographer I have currently been focusing on abstract works that combine unusual patterns and
					shapes with the colors of the every day world. And as a programmer I have been committed to building
					android apps, designing websites, and creating Minecraft server software.
